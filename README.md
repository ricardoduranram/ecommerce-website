# Ecommerce-website
Website was developed using HTML/PHP <br/>
We utilized XAMPP, a simple & lightweight Apache distribution which allows for easy setup of a web server <br/>
To build the database, we utilized MySQL, with ‘phpMyAdmin’ <br/>
A website for an online shop that sells computers, mobile devices, etc. <br/>
The ‘admin page’ of the website allows the user to insert, delete, and update product information, which is connected to the backend database. <br/>
